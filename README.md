📊 EdTech Student Churn & Risk Analysis

🚀 Project Overview

This project analyzes student engagement data from an e-learning platform to identify at-risk students and predict churn behavior using a rule-based analytical framework.

The goal is to help EdTech platforms intervene early, improve retention, and reduce revenue loss caused by student inactivity and poor learning outcomes.

🎯 Business Problem

Student churn is one of the biggest challenges in EdTech platforms.

📉 24% of students become inactive, often due to:

Long inactivity gaps

Low video completion

Poor quiz performance

This project builds a data-driven risk segmentation system to flag such users early
